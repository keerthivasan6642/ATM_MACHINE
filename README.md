# ATM_MACHINE
Project Description: ATM Simulation in Java

The "ATM Simulation in Java" project is a command-line based application that replicates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). The primary goal of this project is to provide users with a simulated experience of managing their bank account by checking their balance, depositing money, withdrawing funds, and printing a receipt. The project incorporates basic user authentication through a PIN number.

Key Features:
1. User Authentication: The program requests the user to input a PIN number to verify their identity before accessing account-related services.

2. Balance Inquiry: Users can check their account balance by selecting the appropriate option from the menu.

3. Deposit Funds: Users have the option to deposit money into their account by entering the desired amount.

4. Withdraw Funds: Users can withdraw money from their account by specifying the amount they want to withdraw. The program performs a balance check to ensure sufficient funds are available before processing the withdrawal.

5. Print Receipt: The program offers the option to print a receipt that displays the account holder's name and the available balance.

6. Exit: Users can exit the ATM simulation by selecting the exit option from the menu.

Technologies Used:
- Java: The project is implemented using the Java programming language, providing object-oriented structure and ease of development.

Main Skills Demonstrated:
- Java Programming: Demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, including user input handling, conditional statements, loops, and switch-case constructs.

- User Interaction: Implements user-friendly input and output mechanisms to provide a seamless experience to users interacting with the ATM simulation.

- Logic and Algorithm: Develops logic for balance management, deposit, and withdrawal processes while considering error handling for various scenarios.

- Command-Line Interface: Constructs a command-line interface that enables users to navigate through the ATM options easily.

- Basic Project Structure: Organizes the code with appropriate functions and modular design, promoting readability and maintainability.

Please note that this project is a simplified simulation and does not involve actual money transactions or security measures, making it suitable for educational purposes. For a real-world ATM system, additional functionalities, security layers, and integration with banking APIs would be required.
